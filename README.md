# Data-Visualisation

Welcome to my Data Visualisation Repository!

Here I showcase some of the data visualisation mini-projects that I have been a part of and thought to be quite interesting. I hope you find these visualisations insightful and possibly beneficialtowards your work. 

The visualisations I have availabale so far include:
  * [Policy responses to COVID-19 in an East African Context](https://github.com/DanKandie/Data-Visualisation/blob/main/Policy%20responses%20to%20COVID-19%20in%20an%20East%20African%20Context.ipynb)
  * [Analysis of the relationship between Weather and happiness](https://github.com/DanKandie/Data-Visualisation/blob/main/Weather%20and%20happiness.ipynb)

Feel free to reach out to me on any comments you may have on the visualisations!
