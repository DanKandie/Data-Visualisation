# Data-Visualisation

Welcome to my Data Visualisation Repository!

Here I showcase some of the data visualisation mini-projects that I have been a part of and thought to be quite interesting. I hope you find these visualisations insightful and possibly beneficialtowards your work. 

The visualisations I have availabale so far include:
  -> Policy responses to COVID-19 in an East African Context
  -> Weather and happiness 

Feel free to reach out to me on any comments you may have on the visualisations!
